Extract Wi-Fi passwords from a non-rooted (really) Android phone

Stuck trying to get your Wi-Fi passwords off your old Android phone?

Normally these aren't accessible from non-rooted Android phones.
Unlocking the bootloader to try to root your phone wipes your phone,
so seems like a Catch-22, however it is still possible to extract
the passwords out using adb. This script automates the process.

January 2019 note: This script worked for my Nexus 5, but doesn't
seem to work on my OnePlus 3T, so maybe Google has since closed the
loophole exploited by this script.
